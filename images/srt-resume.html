                  <p style="width: 609px;"><br />
                    Projects:<br />
                    » Database: Payment network like Zelle. Steps included:
                    Designing of ER, EER and Relational Diagrams. Creating the
                    Database to store the data related to payment and customers.
                    Creating a User-friendly Interface for the users to operate
                    the payment network.<br />
                    » Data Mining: Implementation of Apriori Algorithm using
                    C++. Implemented Classification Algorithms: Random Forests
                    and Decision Trees using Data Mining Tool Weka and provided
                    results and reports based on the calculations for both.
                    Implementation of HITS algorithm for connectivity analysis.<br />
                    » Internet Protocols: Created a text mode DNS server, which
                    listens on a user-specified socket for DNS lookup requests
                    and return (to the client) a list of IP addresses with a
                    preferred address. It was then extended to become a full web
                    proxy that, reads a request from a browser, forwards that
                    request to a web server, reads the reply from the web
                    server, and forwards the reply to the browser. It also had a
                    part to block web requests to certain black listed websites.
                    Also, implemented a simple UDP packet radio transmitter.<br />
                    » Operating Systems: Enabling KVM virtualization for
                    Raspberry Pi and evaluating performance based on OS
                    installed thereafter.<br />
                    » Data Structure: Implementation of Huffman encoding and
                    decoding to compress and decompress arbitrary files such as
                    a .pdf or .jpg or .mp4 etc. Implementation of Kleinberg’s
                    HITS Algorithm and Google’s PageRank algorithm.<br />
                    » Machine Learning: Implementation of the Naive Bayes
                    classifier, gradient descent for minimizing the least
                    squares loss. Programs to optimize the SVM hinge loss
                    descent algorithm, logistic discrimination gradient descent
                    algorithm, program that determines the column with the best
                    split for the CART decision tree algorithm and to perform
                    bagging on the decision a stump and a program to output a
                    k-means clustering.</p>
